# blue_histogramming

Tying together bluesky plans with STOMP messages and Davidia HDF streaming

`mkdir /tmp/rabbitmqdata` for the devcontainer to work ok.

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/stan-dot/blue-histogramming>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install blue-histogramming`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/stan-dot/blue-histogramming:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/stan-dot/blue-histogramming/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from blue_histogramming import __version__

print(f"Hello blue_histogramming {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m blue_histogramming --version
```
