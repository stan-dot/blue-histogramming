# easier
- [x] add descriptros
- [x] add session timeout to settings
- [x] divide image by ROIs
- [x] clean up the top level basemodels
- [x] make stomp listener do redis calls
- [x] put stomp listener as a dependency for singleton injection - per user session
- [x] setup the filesystem observer
- [x] connect the websocket in the demo stream
- [x] get the new metadata for fake stream correct
- [x] add just 1 state handling - no longer direct REDIS calls from rest handlers
- [x] split into rounting by feature - davidia separately from the filesystem stuff
- [ ] edit main and session state amnager side by side, add the redis handling per each endpoint 
- [ ] add blueapi httpx client for interprocess communication - might be better than requests, and need auth and will persist as dependency
- [ ] add nested settings objects really
- [ ] make state manager just one - no need for global state like that raw
- [ ] add 'start demo session' endpoint
- [ ] need just 1 ws endpoint
- [ ] how to push and get back data from davidia? is the server holding just 1 image?
- [ ] should I send back to the UI the davidia plotting url? or just push the data and it would stream the right data?
- [ ] make internal davidia client to push the data to it - the plot id is part of the message, but the uuid is unique
- [ ] make an html based stream for testing maybe?
