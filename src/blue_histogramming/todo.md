# easier
- [x] add descriptros
- [x] add session timeout to settings
- [x] divide image by ROIs
- [x] clean up the top level basemodels
- [x] make stomp listener do redis calls
- [x] put stomp listener as a dependency for singleton injection - per user session
- [ ] setup the filesystem observer
- [ ] connect the websocket in the demo stream
- [ ] get the new metadata for fake stream correct
- [ ] add just 1 state handling - no longer direct REDIS calls from rest handlers

## optional

- [ ] split into rounting by feature - davidia separately from the filesystem stuff
